# 🏡 Housing Data Analysis

This project explores and analyzes a comprehensive housing dataset containing information on over 21,000 residential properties. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and relationships between different housing features and property prices.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **21,613 entries** and **21 columns**, with each row representing a unique property listing. The main target variable is `price` (the sale price of the house). The dataset includes the following key attributes:

| Column Name     | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`            | Unique identifier for each home sale                   |
| `date`          | Date the house was sold                                |
| `price`         | Sale price of the house (target variable)              |
| `bedrooms`      | Number of bedrooms                                     |
| `bathrooms`     | Number of bathrooms                                    |
| `sqft_living`   | Square footage of the interior living space            |
| `sqft_lot`      | Square footage of the lot                              |
| `floors`        | Total number of floors in the house                    |
| `waterfront`    | Binary indicator if the property has a waterfront view |
| `view`          | Quality of the view from the house (0–4)               |
| `condition`     | Condition of the house (1–5)                           |
| `grade`         | Overall grade based on construction and design (1–13)  |
| `sqft_above`    | Square footage of house above ground level             |
| `sqft_basement` | Square footage of the basement                         |
| `yr_built`      | Year the house was built                               |
| `yr_renovated`  | Year the house was renovated                           |
| `zipcode`       | Postal code of the house location                      |
| `lat`           | Latitude coordinate                                    |
| `long`          | Longitude coordinate                                   |
| `sqft_living15` | Living space of the nearest 15 neighbors               |
| `sqft_lot15`    | Lot space of the nearest 15 neighbors                  |

## 🧠 Analysis Highlights

In my analysis, I focused on identifying key factors that influence house prices, including:

* 📈 Correlation between `sqft_living`, `grade`, and `price`
* 🗺️ Location-based trends using `zipcode`, `lat`, and `long`
* 🏗️ Impact of renovation and build year on house value
* 🌊 Influence of features like `waterfront` and `view` on pricing

## 📌 Tools & Techniques

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Data Visualization**
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Predictive Modeling (optional if added)**

## 🚀 Future Work

* Train a regression model to predict house prices
* Deploy a price prediction web app
* Perform geospatial analysis using folium or geopandas
